            <h2 id="designExploration">Design Exploration</h2>

            <p>
                The design exploration is a precursor to the Major Project. In this first stage, we have been asked to
                use the Trove data to create a web-based application which needs to generate interesting ways of
                focusing, filtering, searching, connecting or presenting the data. Besides, I have to produce a poster
                that illustrates explains my design concept.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Here is my idea below:
            </h4>

            <p>
                When I first time open Trove website, I have attracted by a beautiful map so I decided to use these
                categories to build my concept.
            </p>

            <p>
                Therefore, my whole concept plans to use maps, images and digital newspapers categories from Trove. This
                is a web game named ‘link up’, when the user jumps into the webpage, he/ she will need to set a date and
                choose an Australian state first. And then, an old map, will pop up, which represent the period and area
                user chose. What’s more, all news happened in that date will show up as red points. When users use mouse
                hovering on any points, the news title will show. The thing user need to do is to link points which
                title’s end letter is same with the next title’s first letter. For example, I see two titles, one is
                ‘GIANT TOE’ and the other is ‘EDDIE SMITH BRITHDAY’, then I can link them together because ‘TOE’ end
                letter is ‘e’ and ‘EDDIE’ start letter is ‘e’ as well. However, the only rule in this game is that the
                line user linked cannot cross over each other.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition, for the target audience, there are 2 modes in the game. One is versus mode. Users can
                develop their memory, and improve their quick search ability through searching in limit time. Another is
                classic mode which is no time limitation. Although players may not get interest in Australian history,
                through linking the point randomly, they will find some topic they like and they can click the title to
                see the news detail (a little bit like news aggregator).
            </p>

            <p>
                There are 2 screenshots from my poster.
            </p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Process:</h2>

                <p>
                    Before I chose ‘LINK UP’, we have been called upon to think about 5 ideas and share our ideas in
                    class. Depend on what's I have explained, most people in our group like the last idea named
                    ‘DETECTIVE GAME’. However, I like the ‘LINK UP’ most, perhaps the last is easier to make it but for
                    the poster I insist to work on ‘LINK UP’.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection:</h2>

                <p>
                    I have to commit that the presentation for design exploration I did not do well. After listened to
                    my classmates presentations, I realized the importance of idea feasibility. My idea is too idealize
                    to implement and this leads to nobody voting my idea during that section.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Besides, I have a little stage fright when talk to various people. During the presentation, I did
                    not explain my idea clearly and smoothly. Therefore, I think of this the second reason why no one
                    chose my idea.
                </p>

                <h2>Improvement:</h2>

                <p>
                    From this unsuccessful design exploration, I have learned how to think and choose ideas.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First of all, always think about the target audience and idea feasibility;</li>
                    <li>Subsequently, listen to others advice rather than holding self-opinion;</li>
                    <li>Finally, prepare presentation at home and keep practicing my script.</li>
                    <li>Therefore, next time, I believe I will improve a lot.</li>

                </ul>

        <section class="major">

            <div class="container">
                <h2 id="partA">Part A</h2>

                <p>
                    During this section, we have formed into teams, I voted for a classmate who creates a ‘Detective
                    Game’. Because I have a similar idea just like this one, I vote for her. Her idea named ‘Truth
                    Detective’. It is a web based adventure game which contains different types of historical data for
                    users to explore. In this game, players will act as a professional detective who is in charge of a
                    theft case in the 20th century. The objective is that players need to complete three levels,
                    discover the password of a hidden safe in order to find a featured piece of evidence in the
                    mysterious house. Each level contains one question related to one specific aspect on the historical
                    knowledge. Before entering the first level, users are given a question and they must search for
                    clues inside the room. Once they collect all missing puzzles and answer the question correctly, the
                    current level is completed and the room door opens for continuing to the next room.
                </p>


                <h4>Process:</h4>

                <p>
                    In this group, I mainly responsible for UI&UX design. So during this stage, I have decided the basic
                    tone and the style of the game interface like <u>Picture 1</u>.
                </p>
                    <span class="image fit">
                        <img src="image/works/P1.jpg" alt="Picture 1">
                    </span>

                <p>Draw a series of sketches for the game process <u>(Picture2)</u></p>
                    <span class="image fit">
                        <img src="image/works/P2.jpg" alt="Picture2">
                    </span>

                <p>Make the Power Point for virtual add in the presentation <u>(Picture 3)</u></p>
                    <span class="image fit">
                        <img src="image/works/P3.jpg" alt="Picture 3">
                    </span>

                <p>Build the first version of the game logo <u>(Picture 4)</u></p>
                    <span class="image fit small">
                        <img src="image/works/P4.jpg" alt="Picture 4">
                    </span>

                <p>
                    Besides, I have assisted to finalize the game concept. Such as, adding a timer for counting down
                    time. Confirm the target audience is 13-15year old students and reduce the item's bar in the game.
                </p>

                <h4>Reflection:</h4>

                <p>
                    From my observation in the presentation, I found the sketches in the Power Point which it really
                    effective for increasing virtual add. I can see our audience’s smiles and doubt, when they stared at
                    the PPT.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand, the unsuccessful part is the logo. I should not draw sketches first and then draw
                    the logo because when you drew some sketches, you would find it’s hard to decide to create a logo
                    based on these sketch’s style. The sketch has too many features on it, which is notoriously
                    difficult to abstract them in a logo. However, if I create a simple logo first, then it’s easy to
                    make everything behind it. In other words, it’s easy to make things complicated, but it’s hard to
                    simplify them.
                </p>

                <h4>Improvement:</h4>

                <p>
                    Therefore, for rest of works, I will start from the easy thing and then work on the complex one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition, I just feel this logo still does not look good, so I intend to make a new logo and
                    create characters seriously.
                </p>

            </div>

            <hr>

            <div class="container">
                <h2 id="partB">Part B</h2>

                <p>So far, we have finished the major part of our product. We have finalized the story and narratives of
                    the game, created game characters and chapter scenes, designed character dialogues and game clues.
                </p>

                <h4>Process:</h4>

                <p>As for what I have done during part A, it can be basically divided into 2 types. One is the personal
                    work, another is the group work.</p>


                <h4><u>Personal Work:</u></h4>

                <p>
                    I have to admit this is a really struggled period. Particularly for creating the game logo. As you
                    can see from the <u>logo 1</u>, it is the second logo I made for this game and I have mentioned the
                    first logo in Design Exploration. I gave up the first one because I think it is suitable for our
                    game style and it lacks of creativity. However, when I made the second one and showed it to my team
                    members, they all dislike it, and said it looked too blood for our audience.

                </p>

                <span class="image fit small">
                        <img src="image/works/LOGO1.jpg" alt="Logo 1">
                    </span>

                <p>
                    Therefore, I created the third one see <u>logo 2</u>. Actually this is not a single one but a series
                    of logo I made. Because I think this kind of logos can present the final goal of the game (find the
                    diamond to win the game) but I cannot decide which one is the best.
                </p>

                <span class="image fit small">
                        <img src="image/works/LOGO2.jpg" alt="Logo 2">
                    </span>

                <p>
                    However, I showed them to my group they did not quite satisfied with these logos. They mentioned
                    these logos look a little wired, if use them combined with our game.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And then, I realized these kind of logos more suitable for business brand rather than a game. Due to
                    this reason, I created the logo number 4(<u>logo 3</u>). But this is just a demo of logo, I planned
                    to add color and texture in next stage. Unexpectedly, all group members like this logo and they
                    evaluated this one is novel and pretty suited for our audience. Thus, we decided to use this one for
                    our game.

                </p>

                <span class="image fit small">
                        <img src="image/works/logo3.png" alt="Logo 3">
                    </span>


                <p>
                    After the logo design, I started to draw each chapter senses. However, after I finished the 1 scene
                    for the game like <u>picture 5</u>, I found I did not have enough time to draw each chapter senses
                    by myself. Thus, I go to have select suitable online pictures for our game scene.
                </p>

                <span class="image fit">
                        <img src="image/works/P5.jpg" alt="Picture 5">
                </span>

                <p>There is the rest of scenes I used. <u>Picture 6</u></p>

                <span class="image fit">
                        <img src="image/works/P6.jpg" alt="Picture 6">
                </span>

                <p>
                    Inside each scene, I need to create some clickable items for containing game clues, such as a stack
                    of books, a vase, a bundle of letters, a paper plane, etc. here is the items demonstration below
                    (<u>Picture 7</u>).
                </p>
                
                <span class="image fit">
                        <img src="image/works/P7.jpg" alt="Picture 7">
                </span>

                <p>
                    Besides, I also drew game characters. Based on the requirement of characters, the smart and logical
                    detective, and the irritable and arrogant thief. <u>Picture 8</u> is the 2 characters I created.
                </p>
                
                <span class="image fit">
                        <img src="image/works/P8.jpg" alt="Picture 8">
                </span>

                <p>
                    For each character, we designed an image to represent the specific emotion of him. <u>Picture 9</u>
                    creating the variety of character images can increase the engagement and invite our audiences to
                    enjoy the story.
                </p>

                </span>

                <h4><u>Group Work:</u></h4>

                <p>
                    Back to the group work, I have help for designing the game clues. From my perspective, clues design
                    is the hardest part of the design stage, which is the key factor to impact the difficulty and
                    interestingness of the game. For designing clues, we don’t only need to consider the clue itself,
                    but we also have to check whether it can be found from Trove website and how we should get it from
                    Trove. So far, we have designed a draft version of clues, which are all selected elaborately for our
                    game story and all clues material are retrieved by Trove API. The major form of clues are images
                    with captions, which include the actual pictures, screenshots of books, digital newspapers and so
                    on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also participated in designing character dialogue. This is chapter 1 dialogue below which I have
                    written.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    Player: Look! There is a locked door over there. That’s the only way to get out this room.

                <h4>Reflection:</h4>

                <p>
                    Until now, I think everything just runs perfectly. Although we have a couple of technique problems,
                    I believe we can work them out step by step. Especially, my personal work got great feedbacks, most
                    testers like the UI and characters. Some of them even did not recognize they are drawings rather
                    than online images. So I think listen to others opinion is really useful, despite the fact that I
                    may suffer a tough design period like the logo design period but the result is fantastic. Thus, it
                    is worth to do so.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Besides, according to the testers feedbacks, I think the clue might be too difficult to our
                    audience-13-15 years old students, because some of the tester- our classmates felt the game is hard.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What’s more, we think this is a game for gaining historical knowledge so we put long articles in
                    each item. However, testers all said the game has too much reading.
                </p>

                <h4>Improvement:</h4>

                <p>
                    For the rest of part, I will continue to refine my ‘drawings’, and add some details for the game
                    interface. I will highlight the clickable items and dodge the unclickable items’ color because
                    during the testing section, a lot testers click some unclickable items and feel these items look
                    different with others. Besides, I will simplify the game clues and add some graphic clues in order
                    to keep appealing audiences’ attention.

                <h2 id="partC2">Part C</h2>

                <p>According to what we have done and what we plan to do, this stage we have to complete all of our
                    product. During this stage I are still refine my game interface and add more detail for it, work on
                    the rest of game clues and adjust the whole game based on user experience.
                </p>

                <h4>Process:</h4>

                <p>Still, what I have done can be separated into 2 parts, personal work and group work.</p>
                <h4><u>Personal work:</u></h4>

                <p>Based on testers’ reflection, I found a lot of testers cannot find the game question box, so I made a
                    new one, which is more obvious to see. <u>Picture 10</u>
                </p>

                <span class="image fit">
                        <img src="image/works/P10.png" alt="Picture 10">
                </span>

                <p>
                    In order to unify the interface style, I create additional dialogue box too. <u>Picture 11</u>
                    Besides, through the observation in testing, I feel testers want to skip the dialogue or review it
                    depends on different personalities, so I add skip, previous and next button for them to use.
                </p>

                <span class="image fit">
                        <img src="image/works/P11.jpg" alt="Picture 11">
                </span>

                <p>
                    I also refine the logo as I mentioned before, add color and texture for it. See <u>picture 12</u>. I
                    have selected a new typeface for the game, which looks more suitable for the game style, and set it
                    for the entire game to make the game looks tidier and nicer.

                </p>

                </span>


                <h4><u>Group Work:</u></h4>

                <p>
                    I have edited and refined the game clues for some chapters with my group members. For example,
                    chapter 1 purpose is to find who the second owner of the diamond is. We determined that the art
                    gallery serves as this chapter scene so all clues in these works of arts. The first clue in my mind
                    is a portrait of this diamond owner. And then, because the man is a great man, I choose a big event
                    picture which event triggered by him, and I edit a brief introduction for that event. The next clue
                    is about his hobby, so this text covered by a picture which is relevant about his hobby. The last
                    clue is the picture of diamond and a short story about it.

                </p>

                <h4>Reflection:</h4>

                <p>
                    A minor issue I need to improve which is the size of the picture I made. Firstly, I did not think
                    about the difference of PC resolution, so in some widescreen computer the game interface has been
                    expanded, which looks so wired and hilarious. Secondly, I forget to compress images, so all images
                    in our game load on a web a little bit slow than we expected. Thirdly, I did not crop pictures
                    through the picture’s margin after drew, so when I set them in HTML, which is hard to control their
                    sizes based on so much space in pictures. Finally, I did not name each picture properly, which lead
                    to my group members very confused what it is in our HTML code.
                </p>

                <h4>Improvement:</h4>

                <p>
                    Definitely, I will improve my picture issues. Next time I will create a 4:3 version and a 16:9
                    version of pictures for different resolution. I will compress all pictures for fast loading in the
                    web. I will crop all pictures through their margin for using them conveniently. Of course, I have to
                    name my pictures properly based on what they are.

            <p>
                The final product of this web based portfolio includes in an in depth documentation of three main
                projects that I have created over the last 3 months. These three projects are design exploration, design
                computing as well as this portfolio itself. In each page, for these three projects, its final product,
                the process in obtaining the final product, my personal contribution to each project, project reflection
                and improvements that can be made are discussed.
            </p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Process:</h2>

                <p>
                    This portfolio was a bit challenging to start because I was free to design and layout the website as
                    I wanted. As a result of this, the design mainly reflects myself as a designer. This can be depicted
                    through the color scheme that has been used which are black, white and grey as there are some of my
                    most preferred colors. Furthermore, the design and layout of the portfolio is unclustered and
                    minimalistic which again I feel reflects myself as a designer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I decided to make design and layout for the pages of the three main projects the same as the content
                    required in each page are the same and I also feel this would create a flow towards the portfolio.
                    The layout can be mainly separated into 2 parts. The left is a brief introduction about myself. The
                    right side comprising by all of my stories about the main project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The main languages used to create the portfolio are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have also used
                    artefacts such as images and sketches in order to aid visitors in understanding each project and
                    make the portfolio more appealing.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection:</h2>

                <p>
                    I am delighted with the outcome of the portfolio. I feel that the design and layout is a reflection
                    of myself as a designer. I also feel that the navigation links at the right of each screen as well
                    as colored links in the content are clear enough for the user to know exactly what they will see by
                    clicking on those links. As one of the main aims of the portfolio was to ensure the users can easily
                    understand the layout and navigate through each page, I feel that I have achieved it by successfully
                    designing and implementing the portfolio.
                </p>

                <h2>Improvement:</h2>

                <p>
                    Although I achieved what I wanted to in this portfolio, I felt that there are still some
                    improvements that can be made. Firstly, although I was looking for tidy and simple design, more work
                    could have been done on some part of the design such as the main title which reads "Xi Chen's
                    Portfolio". Although the black color still coincides with the color scheme, more work, if time
                    permitted, could have been done to design a better and more appealing font.

                <h4>Meeting Expectations:</h4>

                <p>
                    After looked back to my post in week one, I feel very happy with the outcome I got and I almost meet
                    all my original expectation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Firstly, I have learned HTML and CSS from an absolute beginner. Before I learned this course, I did
                    not have any code experience but now I already can design and complete a personal portfolio be
                    myself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Secondly, I have worked with my group member very well. Instead of my original expectation, all my
                    group members are very nice person. They are glad to help each other and nobody drag down the
                    product progress.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, I remember at the beginning of this course, I wondered this course needs a highly
                    self-learning skill, so I need to learn a lot by myself but why I pay for this course?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Right now, I have an answer! If I do not pay for this course or say attend this course, I will never
                    try to learn this knowledge. Therefore, now I am really appreciated learning this course and this
                    course actually teaches me a lot.

                </p>

                <h4>Learning across the course</h4>

                <p>
                    The most important thing I have learned is the testing section. Because testers or say unfamiliar
                    person of your project always can give you some useful feedback. Because when you are familiar with
                    your project, you may become blind with the drawbacks of your project. Furthermore, from the
                    tester’s suggestion, you will not deviate from the target audience. They will always give you
                    feedback from the audience perspective.
                </p>
                <h4>Changes to improve my experience of the course:</h4>

                <p>
                    Looking back on what we have done for this semester, I would like to say that I really enjoy the
                    whole process. Generally speaking, as an international student that we should more communicate with
                    student from different countries and be a group. Because the people come from different countries
                    have different culture may create different ideas and viewpoint leading the product become
                    multicultural and more interesting. However, our group members all come from China during this
                    project, it has both advantages and disadvantages. Limit thinking and weak grammar are our
                    weaknesses. On the other hand, same cultural background leading us has good communication and more
                    efficiency.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is obvious successfully complete the entire project relies on lots of things: one is a group of
                    hard working members and another is an effective working group. Obviously, these are very closely
                    related to the group work. I had experience of working with a group, and I knew some skills of
                    working with others. Nonetheless, there is something that I need to improve in my future teamwork.
                    In the group, it is important to show your enthusiasm and be active in the group. And never feel shy
                    to ask questions and ask for help. Secondly, be patient to listen to other’s opinions. Everyone has
                    his or her own point of view based on discrete thinking, and there is never right or wrong. We
                    should discuss them and found out the right one for group work. Thirdly, communication plays an
                    essential role during group work. Any decisions are based on good communication. And I believe the
                    best way to communicate with people is face to face. These are all helpful group skills that I have
                    learnt in our group over the semester.
